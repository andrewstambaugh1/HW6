First of all, I can see that near election years, the election itself always shoots up to the top keyword, and there is more press in general.
However, the 2016 election was a keyword in over 2000 more headlines in its year than the 2012 election in 2012. During and after the 2016 election, 
United Stated Politics and Government as a keyword went from ~2500 a year to over 5500 a year. Furthermore, political topics in general, such as the Republican Party, 
Donald Trump, and International Relations, become MUCH more popular after the 2016 election. In conclusion, the 2016 election made the US politics in general a much 
bigger topic in the press, at least for the New York Times.
